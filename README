RockBand StageKit API
Linux support libraries for the PDP Rock Band Stage Kit, including full control over the strobe, fog, and led lights.
-----------------------------

USAGE:
    To use the API, simply put the stagekit.h and stagekit.c files in the relevant spot of your project directory,
#include them, and then issue an sk_init(char *filename) where filename is the location of the appropriate event file
(such as /dev/input/event5), and then use any of the other commands according to what you want to do.

sk_init(char *filename)
    Open an event interface file for a stage kit. If set to NULL, the API will attempt to probe for one automatically.

sk_close()
    Closes the file handles for the stage kit.

sk_alloff()
    Sends a "panic" signal to turn everything off at once.

sk_nostrobe()
    Disable strobe

sk_slowstrobe()
    Sets a slow strobe

sk_medstrobe()
    Sets a medium strobe

sk_faststrobe()
    Sets a fast strobe

sk_fasteststrobe()
    Sets the fastest strobe

sk_fogon()
    Turn on the fogger

sk_fogoff()
    Turn off the fogger

sk_setred(i)
    Set the red leds according to the first 8 bits of i, where each bit represents a single led

sk_setyellow(i)
    Set the yellow leds according to the first 8 bits of i, where each bit represents a single led

sk_setgreen(i)
    Set the green leds according to the first 8 bits of i, where each bit represents a single led

sk_setblue(i)
    Set the blue leds according to the first 8 bits of i, where each bit represents a single led

sk_setleds(r,y,g,b)
    Set all the led arrays, with the same convention as the other ones, but all at once, with r being red, y being yellow, etc.
    Merely a convenience function; the same as calling the sk_setred, sk_setyellow, sk_setgreen, and sk_setblue functions one after another
